	* version 3.2.2
	- Fixed minor bug in rwaln test routine. It assumed that input alignments
	were correctly formatted (which was not true for one test case). The
	kalign executable was never affected by this.
	- Added a script to test a few alignments.

	minor bug fix removed "-lrt" required for old glibc versions and replaced
	with a search in configure.ac: AC_SEARCH_LIBS([clock_gettime],[rt])

	* version 3.2.0

	Added support for reading sequences from standard input:

	cat file.fasta | kalign -f fasta | ....

	Added support for combining multiple input files into one alignment:

	kalign sequencesA.fa sequencesB.fa > msa.fa

	Also works in combination:

	cat file.fasta | kalign sequencesA.fa sequencesB.fa > msa.fa

	Minor:
	- added m4 macros to enable / disable compiler flags
	- added m4 macro for valgrind. Now there is a make target
	called check-valgrind that run all tests through valgrind.

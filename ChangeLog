	version 3.2.1

	Added support for reading sequences from standard input:

	cat file.fasta | kalign -f fasta | ....

	Added support for combining multiple input files into one alignment:

	kalign sequencesA.fa sequencesB.fa > msa.fa

	Also works in combination:

	cat file.fasta | kalign sequencesA.fa sequencesB.fa > msa.fa

	Minor:
	- added m4 macros to enable / disable compiler flags
	- added m4 macro for valgrind. Now there is a make target
	called check-valgrind that run all tests through valgrind.
